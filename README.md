# Paint-Lite

## Description
Hello everyone and welcome to Paint Lite, a project inspired directly by the Microsoft's Paint app, well known from everybody.
I wanted to recreate an drawing application that can also work as an image/graphical editor to a very limited extent.
Here, you can choose your colors, thickness and style of your brushes, and save your works !
